# Daily forward-prediction pipeline

Purpose: from the first 2026-27 tip (late Oct 2026) every game becomes a truly
out-of-sample test. `season=2025` is burned (see `HOLDOUT_ACCESS_LOG.md`); forward
predictions, written before tip-off and scored afterwards, are the only clean
holdout available. Read-only w.r.t. markets: no orders, no credentials.

## Commands (all `uv run`)

```
uv run python -m nba.daily run --date 2026-10-28      # ingest, injury report, predict, settle
uv run python -m nba.daily settle                     # score completed predictions only
uv run python -m nba.daily report                     # writes registry_store/reports/forward_report.md
# flags: --skip-ingest --skip-injury --no-props --db-path PATH --rate-limit-s 0.6
```

`run` exits 2 if any slate game had already tipped (those games get no prediction;
nothing is back-filled). `nba.duckdb` is single-writer: do not run while an eval holds it.

## Run steps

1. **Ingest** (`ingest_step.py`): refreshes `games` for the season string
   (`2026-27`) by calling the games fetcher directly. `pull_season_games` is NOT used
   because it is cached forever per season key and would freeze the season at its first
   pull. Then `pull_game_boxscore` (per-game cache, resumable) for completed games with no
   `player_game_stats` rows (cap 250/run).
2. **Schedule** (`schedule.py`): nba_api `ScheduleLeagueV2` gives game ids and UTC tip
   times; the slate is games whose US-Eastern tip date equals `--date`.
3. **Injury report** (`injury.py`): probes 15-minute slots newest-first, strictly before
   `min(now, earliest tip-off)`, and pulls the first existing PDF through
   `pull_official_injury_report`. A feed failure is recorded in the run summary and never
   blocks the Elo forecast. Props exclude players marked `out` in the latest snapshot
   (<=36 h old).
4. **Models**: `resolve_production` calls `registry.load_model(name, 'production')`; if
   nothing is promoted the run records version `unregistered` (config fallback) rather than
   failing.
   - Win prob: `MovEloBaseline` with `configs/mov_elo_tuned.yaml`, refit on every completed
     game with `game_date < slate date` (cheap, deterministic). On the first day of a new
     season the season-boundary carryover regression is applied explicitly, because `fit`
     only regresses between seasons it sees.
   - Props (pts/reb/ast/fg3m): **rolling 82-game average baseline** (normal), for players
     in a slate team's last 10 games with >=5 games, conditional on playing. This is a
     placeholder, not the routed sim (see Hooks).
5. **Write** (`store.py`): append-only `forward_predictions`. Any `made_at >= tipoff`
   raises `LeakageError` and the whole batch is refused. Reruns add rows; settlement scores
   the latest prediction per key, all of which are pre-tip.
6. **Settle**: for completed games, appends `forward_scores`: log loss and Brier (win),
   closed-form normal CRPS (props). A player with no minutes is logged `dnp` and excluded
   from metrics (props are conditional on playing; the count is reported).
7. **Report**: log loss / Brier (and log loss minus the naive p=0.5 reference) and prop
   CRPS / bias, each with a percentile bootstrap that resamples **game dates** (2000 draws,
   seed 0), plus n and number of dates. Warns when n < 100 settled games.
   **Rollover trigger:** when >=20 completed `season=2026` games are in `games`, the report
   states the HOLDOUT_ACCESS_LOG rule-3 action (re-designate the holdout as 2026, fold 2025
   into tuning, never tune on 2026 before first confirmatory use). The pipeline never edits
   the log; do that by hand.

## Tables (created by `ensure_tables`, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`)

NOT added to `nba/db/schema.sql` (not owned here). Fold the DDL in `nba/daily/store.py`
into schema.sql when convenient (idempotent, safe to apply twice).

- `forward_predictions(run_id, made_at, game_id, tipoff, model_name, version, target,
  player_id, prediction JSON)`; `player_id = -1` for game-level targets (spec columns plus
  `player_id`, needed for props). Timestamps are naive UTC.
- `forward_scores(scored_at, game_id, game_date, season, model_name, version, target,
  player_id, made_at, y, pred, log_loss, brier, crps, status)`.

## Season encoding

`games.season` is the start year: 2025 = 2025-26, so 2026-27 = **2026**
(`nba.ingest.games.season_to_int`). Pullers take any `YYYY-YY` string; they were not
modified. `nba.daily.season` maps a date to the string (Aug-Dec -> that year, else year-1).

## Scheduling on this Mac

`nba/daily/com.nba-prediction.daily.plist.template` is a user-level LaunchAgent template
(NOT installed): two runs a day (11:00, 16:30 local, assumed US-Eastern). A scheduled job
on your own laptop is not always-on infra; launchd runs a missed job on wake. Install and
removal commands are in the template header. Keep the Mac plugged in; the job is light
(one schedule call, one games call, a handful of box scores).

## Caveats (honest)

- The nba_api `ScheduleLeagueV2` column names (`gameId`, `gameDateTimeUTC`,
  `homeTeam_teamId`, `awayTeam_teamId`) and the injury-report slot probing are written from
  the documented shapes and tested on fixtures only; do one supervised live run on a
  preseason/early day before trusting the schedule.
- Games with unknown/late tip-off are never predicted (cannot prove made_at < tipoff).
- A game ingested late in `games` (box score missing) stays unsettled until its box score
  arrives.
- Win-prob and props models are the existing baselines; early-season samples are tiny.
  Expect CIs spanning zero for weeks; report n with every number.

## Hooks wanted from other modules (not edited here)

1. `nba.registry`: a registered, promoted `rung0_mov_elo` version whose artifact dir holds
   the config yaml, so `resolve_production` returns a real version (today: `unregistered`).
2. `nba.props` / `nba.sim`: a forward `predict_slate(con, as_of, games, out_players)` that
   returns per-player distributions without needing actuals (the current entrypoints are
   backtest-shaped). Until then props use the rolling-average baseline.
3. `nba.ingest.games`: a public `refresh_season_games(con, season)` (uncached) replacing
   the private `_fetch_games_for_season` import used here.
4. `nba/db/schema.sql`: optionally absorb the two forward tables.
